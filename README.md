## Features

### Navigation Bar
<ul>
    <li>You will find the navigationbar with three links at the right top of the page.

### Footer
<ul>
    <li>The footer is really small but handy because it provides links for socialmedia for those who are even more interested in getting to know the owner of Rydbergs Ateljé. For marketing, this is perhaps the most important links the owner wants the customer to find, because of that the position of this is fixed so it is easy to find regardless on where you are on the website.</li>

### Extra features for future developement
<ul>
    <li>A copy of the whole page but with all swedish text, two links in the header with to navigate between the two languages</li>
    <li>Make all the list items beneath "Previous collaborations" also work as links to the websites of theese companys, this will help the user understand more about the work they do if they dont recognise the company by the name</li>
    <li>Give the navigation bar a fixed position and add a "home" link. This will give the user access to navigate through the page even when they already scrolled down a bit.</li>
    <li>Make social media links bigger or at least with bigger space between eachother so it is easier to klick on mobile phone where you use you fingers instead of mouse.</li>
</ul>

## Testing
<ul>
    <li>The links in the navigation bar works well, brings me down to the section with the same name.</li>
    <li>Social media links takes me to the right pages and opens up in a new tab (Though the company that the website presents dont have any social media right now it only leads to Instagram and Facebooks homepage, this is easy to change when the company has its own socialmedia to link to)</li>
    <li>The form works well, the "Phonenumber" field doesent approve letters and the "Email" field doesent approve content without @ in it. When you click the submit button it will take you to an error site, this is because the "action" attribute is not linked to anything yet.</li>
    <li>The map in the contact section brings you to google maps and opens up in a new tab</li>
    <li>The website changes its layout when you make the screen bigger or smaller. It is tested and looks good on all screenwidths between 1920px and 250px.</li>
