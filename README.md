### Footer
<ul>
    <li>The footer is really small but handy because it provides links for socialmedia for those who are even more interested in getting to know the owner of Rydbergs Ateljé. For marketing, this is perhaps the most important links the owner wants the customer to find, because of that the position of this is fixed so it is easy to find regardless on where you are on the website.</li>
</ul>

### Extra features for future developement
<ul>
    <li>A copy of the whole page but with all swedish text, two links in the header with to navigate between the two languages</li>
    <li>Make all the list items beneath "Previous collaborations" also work as links to the websites of theese companys, this will help the user understand more about the work they do if they dont recognise the company by the name</li>
</ul>

## Testing
<ul>
    <li>The links in the navigation bar works well, brings me down to the section with the same name.</li>
    <li>Social media links takes me to the right pages and opens up in a new tab (Though the company that the website presents dont have any social media right now it only leads to Instagram and Facebooks homepage, this is easy to change when the company has its own socialmedia to link to)</li>
    <li>The form works well, the "Phonenumber" field doesent approve letters and the "Email" field doesent approve content without @ in it. When you click the submit button it will take you to an error site, this is because the "action" attribute is not linked to anything yet.</li>
    <li>The map in the contact section brings you to google maps and opens up in a new tab</li>
    <li>The website changes its layout when you make the screen bigger or smaller. It is tested and looks good on all screenwidths between 1920px and 250px.</li>

## Validator Testing
### HTML
<ul>
    <li>No errors found when passing through <a src="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjessicarydberg.github.io%2FRydbergs_Atelje%2F">W3C validator</a></li>
    <li>One warning was found when passing through <a src="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjessicarydberg.github.io%2FRydbergs_Atelje%2F">W3C validator.</a> It warns about the first sections not containing a heading, such as h2-h6 element. My opinion is that the section looks really good without heading and I want the listitems to be in the same size as other list items on the website so changing it to an h2-h6 element will only make the css code for it more complicated and not clean. So I chose to keep my website as it is.</li>
</ul>

### CSS
<ul>
    <li>No errors found when passing through <a src="https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2Fjessicarydberg.github.io%2FRydbergs_Atelje%2F">(Jigsaw) validator.</a></li>
