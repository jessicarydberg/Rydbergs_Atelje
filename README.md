# Rydbergs Ateljé
Rydbergs Ateljé is a website that provides information about the person behind the sewing- and design- studio called Rydbergs Ateljé. The website helps the owner and the potential costumers to comunicate. It shows the costumers what kind of help you can expect in Rydbergs Ateljé and how to get in touch with the owner. It also helps the owner to show off her work and reach out to new costumers

## Features

### Navigation Bar
<ul>
    <li>You will find the navigationbar with four links at the right top of the page. Theese helps the user to navigate faster down the page in those cases where they only need some specific information. The links turn brown when you hover over them to show the user that "this is a link".</li>
    <li>The navigation bar has a fixed position which gives the user easy access to it regardless on where you are at the page</li>
</ul>

### Home section
<ul>
    <li>The first section is designed to present a clear picture of where they have come and what they will find here. First the logo telling the user what company this website is about. Then they will see a picture of the person behind the company and some short and easy information about what skills she have. The colors, pictures and design will give the visitor a feeling of what kind of design and style her work goes in line with.</li>

### Extra features for future developement
<ul>
    <li>Make all the list items beneath "Previous collaborations" also work as links to the websites of theese companys, this will help the user understand more about the work they do if they dont recognise the company by the name</li>
</ul>

## Testing
<ul>
    <li>The links in the navigation bar works well, brings me down to the section with the same name.</li>
    <li>Social media links takes me to the right pages and opens up in a new tab (Though the company that the website presents dont have any social media right now it only leads to Instagram and Facebooks homepage, this is easy to change when the company has its own socialmedia to link to)</li>
    <li>The form works well, the "Phonenumber" field doesent approve letters and the "Email" field doesent approve content without @ in it. When you click the submit button it will take you to an error site, this is because the "action" attribute is not linked to anything yet.</li>
    <li>The map in the contact section brings you to google maps and opens up in a new tab</li>
    <li>The website changes its layout when you make the screen bigger or smaller. It is tested and looks good on all screenwidths between 1920px and 250px.</li>
